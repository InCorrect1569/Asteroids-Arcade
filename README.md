# Asteroids - https://asteroids.incorrect1569.repl.co/
The best game I have ever made is this game. This is my remix of the original Asteroids game that was developed by Atari in 1979...
The controls are: left key to turn left and right key to turn right, space key to shoot and up key to go forward.
Note: Please click the screen once the game has loaded and opened.
In this game, You have to shoot down the Asteroids before they hit you. You have three lives. As the levels progress, the difficulty increases by adding more asteroids and much bigger ones.
